I’ve just pushed out [version 1.1][paraphernalia] of my [Adium][adium] message style.

   [paraphernalia]: http://adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=5493
   [adium]: http://adiumx.com/

## Changelist

* Margin above the first message, so it doesn’t look like it’s stuck to the window’s title bar.
* Long usernames are cut off if they don’t fit.
* Two new background images.
