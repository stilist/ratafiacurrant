The idea of changing what was a great way to share mixtapes — a very personal listener’s view of music — into yet another way for marketing machines to push bands is terribly disappointing.

I understand that legal wrangling is distasteful, and that bills must be paid. But this is very much _not_ what the site was about. Far better to just walk away and let everybody remember the brief glory.

Muxtape is dead.
