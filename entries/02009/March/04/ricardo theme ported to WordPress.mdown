The process took about two hours, including updating WordPress and fixing
a configuration issue. There is some slight mismatch between the two, largely
due to platform differences, but I was able to simply copy and paste a good
deal of the code.

## Issues

* Is there a template tag to check if next/previous pagination will be
generated? I don’t want to have unnecessary markup rendered. Tumblr allows me
to do this by wrapping all my pagination code in
`{block:Pagination}…{/block:Pagination}` tags, and the next/previous links in
`{block:NextPage}…{NextPage}…{/block:NextPage}`. WordPress only seems to
provide a way to generate the links directly with `next_posts_link`.
* I’m unclear on exactly how to set up archives. The
[instructions in the Codex][wpcar] seem to be a version behind.
* Bizarrely, the page renders differently when I use
<abbr class='smallcaps'>CSS</abbr>, even though it’s exactly the same as the
remote copy I use with Tumblr. For now the `style.css` file is present simply
because it’s required to give metadata.
