Not much to say. Finished reading <span class='comic'>The Invisibles</span> 
today; I was inspired to make something that looked like Barbelith. Had to make
some alterations.

The <abbr>nav</abbr> was a last-moment change after I stopped recording for the
screencast; itâ€™s an improvement, but still not great.
