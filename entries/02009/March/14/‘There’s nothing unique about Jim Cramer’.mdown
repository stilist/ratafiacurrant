<span class='person'>Glenn Greenwald</span> argues that leading journalists are
sometimes *proud* of their willingness to pass along information without
digging to see if the information is true.

> And now that they’re being called upon to explain why they did this, their
> excuse is: *Well, we were lied to. What could we have done?* And the obvious
> answer, which <span class='person'><ins>Jon</ins> Stewart</span> repeatedly
> expressed, is that people who claim to be “reporters” are obligated not only
> to provide a forum for powerful people to make claims, but also to *then
> investigate those claims and then to inform the public if the claims are
> true.* That’s about as basic as it gets.
>
> …
>
> But the <span class='person'><ins>Jim</ins> Cramer</span>-like journalistic
> behavior during that period that was so widespread and did so much damage is
> behavior that *our press corps, to this day, believes is proper and
> justified.*
