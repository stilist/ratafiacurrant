![Graph of The Settlers of Catan sales][chart]

This graphic is taken from [<span class='magazine'>Wired</span>’s
article][tsoc] <span class='game'>The Settlers of Catan</span>. Kind of a
trivial complaint, but: I think it’s a bad chart.

It’s so obvious that it shows massive sales growth, with over 600,000 units in
02008… except that’s not what it’s showing at all. The label for the Y axis
reads ‘*Cumulative* Unit Sales’, which means the data is actually a lot less
dramatic than it seems. It’s solid growth year-over-year, but 150,000 units is
rather less than 600,000. And the caption does nothing to clarify: ‘Released in
1995, The Settlers of Catan only recently caught fire in the U.S’.

So while the chart isn’t an outright *lie* — it wasn’t created by a marketing
department, I’m assuming — the data could definitely have been presented in a
more honest manner.
