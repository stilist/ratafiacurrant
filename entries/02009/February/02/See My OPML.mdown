When I [wrote about journalism][wej] the other day, I noted that I generally
follow my rule that sources should be open by sharing all my bookmarks. That
neglects a major set of sources, though — feed subscriptions. So today I’ve
pushed [an <abbr class='smallcaps'>OPML</abbr> file][opml] with my
subscriptions to [the site’s repository][git]. It’s almost exactly what I see,
with two exceptions: the <abbr class='smallcaps'>OPML</abbr> export didn’t
include the folders I use (so it’s pretty disorganized), and I took out a few
personal blogs that I don’t use for source material anyways. In exchange I’ve
left in some more lighthearted material that I don’t use for source material
either.

 [opml]: http://github.com/stilist/ratafiacurrant/blob/master/subscriptions.opml

I’ll push out occasional updates as I change my subscriptions, but that doesn’t
seem to happen terribly often.
