I’m in the process of applying to a number of jobs, most of which require a
portfolio (who’d’ve thought?). I’d known for a while that I’d need one, but
kept finding more interesting things to do.

Last night I decided to just get it over with, since it’s actually
necessary now. It took four to five hours to collect the designs, crop them,
code the <abbr class='smallcaps'>HTML</abbr>, and make up the layout as I went.
It’s simple, but I’m pleased with it.

If you’d like to see the page (rather than just a screenshot),
<a href='mailto:stilist@ratafia.info'>send me an email</a>.
