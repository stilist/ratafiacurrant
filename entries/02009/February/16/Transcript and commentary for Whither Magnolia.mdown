Transcription of Citizen Garden episode 11, [‘Whither Magnolia’][cgwm].

As you may or may not be aware, the Ma.gnolia bookmarking service recently
[lost its entire database][gmdl].

 [gmdl]: http://google.com/search?q=ma.gnolia%20data%20january%202009 "Google results for Ma.gnolia data loss"

I was not personally affected by this loss, as I instead use delicious and
[back up my bookmarks][rcdb] daily. I had briefly tried Ma.gnolia; after
[a lengthy wait][twit1] while it processed my bookmark collection, I soon
decided that the system simply [didn’t allow for the things I wanted to
do][twit2].

 [rcdb]: http://ratafia.info/post/72095951/how-to-easily-back-up-your-delicious-bookmarks
 [twit1]: http://twitter.com/stilist/status/1122199894
 [twit2]: http://twitter.com/stilist/status/1122373387

But even if I didn’t lose anything, a lot of people did. And if delicious were
to disappear, I might still have my data, but I wouldn’t have a way to use it
(immediately, anyhow; there are open-source importers). So this is still a good
thing to think about.

Although <span class='person'>Chris Messina</span> [doesn’t seem overly
concerned with the loss of his bookmarks][fcdata], I make heavy use of my
bookmark archive — collecting things like [article series][dchome],
[free-culture content][dccom], [free music][dfmus], and a variety of other
purposes. For me, it doesn’t have <q>a half-life of twenty-four hours</q>; I
bookmark so that I can quickly re-find things that have interested me. I’m
willing to grant that I’m an outlier; the number of tags I use per bookmark
likely ensures that anyways.

But even if bookmarking is done on a very short-term basis, it’s useful, as
the podcast points out, for things like generating recommendations. A major
trend in my feed subscription habits is that I love sites which point out
things I’d never see otherwise. As <span class='person'>Dave Winer</span> says,
[<q>People come back to places that send them away</q>][send]. Although I
didn’t use Ma.gnolia in its pre-crash form, I’d be very interested in one that
tried to give me a list of interesting links. I’ve lately begun skimming the
front pages of Digg and Reddit several times a day — which, while useful, also
means I have to see a lot of things that I really don’t care about. Links
recommended by a computer aren’t quite on the level of links recommended by
people I trust to be interesting, but it can be very close.

Regardless of whether Ma.gnolia ever appeals to me personally, I hope it comes
back stronger than it was. Competition is good, and the service has a chance to
move things in interesting new directions.

## Transcript

> <cite><abbr title='Larry Halff'>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Hello, and welcome to episode eleven of the [Citizen Garden podcast][cgp].
> We’re actually coming to you today via video as well. I’m Larry Halff.</q>

> <cite><abbr title='Chris Messina'>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I’m Chris Messina.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>And today we are going to talk about what happened with Ma.gnolia.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah. Which I guess is, for many people, not *that* funny, but uh, it’s
> fairly, I guess, sort of a momentous thing, and of course you being the news
> creates an interesting opportunity for us, I guess, to both talk about what
> happened, and for you to sort of explain maybe the situation as it occurred,
> what’s happened since, what you’ve done sort of in response, and maybe some
> lessons learned here. So maybe you wanna give us some background on what
> actually happened.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Uh, so, I still don’t have all the details on what happened; still
> working with <ins>a?</ins> data recovery company and hope to know more when I
> hear back from them, but: what seemed to me to have happened was we had some
> file system corruption and our very large database file got corrupt and…</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>What size database file are we talking here?</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>It was approaching half a terabyte of everything together, and…</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Is this
> My<abbr class='smallcaps' title='Structured Query Language'>SQL</abbr>,
> or…</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah, My<abbr class='smallcaps'>SQL</abbr>;
> My<abbr class='smallcaps'>SQL</abbr> 5.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Okay.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>And… I think this had been somewhat of an ongoing issue, but everything
> was running even though this was going on. And eventually it stopped running,
> and the site went down. It just no longer worked. And because of this, our
> not-so-awesome backup system also failed, because it was not able to properly
> back up the data from My<abbr class='smallcaps'>SQL</abbr>.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Is that because of the size, or I mean… so what, maybe you can talk a
> little bit about what you know what happened with the backup.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So what happened with the backup was it was just trying to back up bad
> data, so whatever the backup produced was not usable either. It was just
> giving a file sync over a Firewire network to a different machine. So, in
> this case, because we didn’t have a good sort of integrity-oriented backup
> system, it failed.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Now, had you ever done tests or anything like that to see..?</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Nope. Had not purposely failed the database to see what would happen.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I see, so…</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Which would… which is one of those lessons learned, which is: test your
> backups, test your backup system. I don’t know that a test would have caught
> this sort of thing, but it’s something we should have done. And another
> lesson learned would be: figure out your backup, figure out a good versioned
> backup system early on. Or actually the *real* lesson learned is if you’re a
> startup, don’t do your own <abbr class='smallcaps'>IT</abbr> at all, which
> is… And I think three years ago, it was less of an eff — three, four years
> ago it was less of an option. Ma.gnolia, I really started on Ma.gnolia four
> years ago, and we were running the beta over three years ago. And there was
> not… there was no sort of cloud computing at that time. So it was the, you
> know, the option was really bad hosting, especially for Rails applications,
> hosting that…</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>It almost didn’t exist back then.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I knew wouldn’t scale. Or do-it-yourself. And sort of in the process of
> developing Ma.gnolia, infrastructure always sort of took a back seat. And
> along the way we suffered because of that; y’know, I’d say in about
> <ins>0</ins>2006 we definitely attrition from the service because of speed
> and reliability.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Performance.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah, the performance, the site would slow down. But because you… because
> we were developing Ma.gnolia specifically for the environment it was deployed
> in, there was… there is a huge tax to sort of moving to a completely new
> environment. We have all sorts of dependencies, all sorts of stuff that we
> required in our specific environment.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Now, I mean, maybe you could talk a little about the actual
> infrastructure, y’know, the environment you had set up, from a hardware
> perspective. Because I think one of the things that, y’know, most people
> probably have no insight into, y’know — unlike your Mac you can’t go to the
> little Apple, y’know, and choose ‘tell me about this Mac’, and get the 
> specs.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Right.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Y’know, for web apps. And maybe you can talk about, you know, the actual
> system that you were running Ma.gnolia off of.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So we were running Ma.gnolia on… the database and the backup were on a
> couple of [Xserves][xserve], and then we had about four [minis][mini]…</q>

 [mini]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Mini "Wikipedia article for Mac mini"
 [xserve]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xserve "Wikipedia article for Xserve"

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Mac minis.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Mac minis. <ins>?</ins> Mac minis that were running as frontend web
> servers. So it was a very small setup, and… I mean, interestingly, y’know,
> with a pretty good Xserve as the main database server, it ran pretty
> well.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>And you weren’t doing anything like
> [<abbr class='smallcaps'>RAID</abbr>][raid] or anything with it, it was just Firewire backup.</q>

 [raid]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID "Wikipedia article for RAID"

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>The server was <abbr class='smallcaps'>RAID</abbr>. Its disk was
> <abbr class='smallcaps'>RAID</abbr>, so that’s one of the things we’re
> looking at. But it was a software <abbr class='smallcaps'>RAID</abbr>, so if
> it’s a filesystem problem then… that’s not gonna do any good because the the
> errors were <abbr class='smallcaps'>RAID</abbr>ed as well.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So let’s talk a little bit about, I mean, the reaction, y’know, to this
> so far. The reaction I’ve seen has been somewhat mixed. Y’know, there
> obviously was <ins lang='la'>sic</ins> some articles that came out, that
> sorta like, rightly pointed out that this was a bad thing that happened, and
> yet — I guess maybe you can speak to, because obviously you’re directly
> involved with it — the reaction from both individual users of Ma.gnolia,
> y’know, as well as, y’know, sorta like the larger media that’s like
> <span class='magazine'>Wired</span> and so on.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So I think, um, the reaction has been actually mostly supportive and
> understanding.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah, I’ve seen a lot of that.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I’d say ninety percent of what I’ve been getting and reading has been,
> y’know, not tearing down, not flaming, not griefing. And the negative
> reactions out there, I think a lot of them are valid. It’s… I made a huge
> mistake in terms of how I set up our system, and the — when people criticize
> that, they’re completely right. I have no problem with that. There have been
> some personal attacks, but… I think people get frustrated, rightly
> frustrated, and angry and sort of fall back into that mode, where they want
> someone to go after, and make it personal since they feel like they were
> personally let down.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>It’s also been interesting to see the characterizations of ‘Ma.gnolia
> and <abbr>co.</abbr>’, or ‘Ma.gnolia and team’, as though you’re this large
> operation, y’know, with international offices and things like that. I
> mean…</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I think that’s another lesson learned, which is, like, we always appeared
> bigger than we were. And it was *me*, and it’s basically been me. As of late,
> there was… for much of Ma.gnolia’s life, there was a small team; I think the
> largest we ever got was four. So we somehow projected this image of this, you
> know, big company with, you know, huge offices and cubicles and the whole
> works, and it was, you know… it’s really just, it’s really just basically me.
> And I don’t think… I mean, I think it was flattering that that’s the
> perception, but I think it was a mistake to not work harder to let people
> know exactly what we were and how big we were, in terms of how personal the
> service actually is.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>That says, I think that says a lot to a lot of the lessons coming out of
> social media lately; I think, y’know, around transparency and openness,
> which, obviously, Obama says a lot about, but there is some degree of truth
> there. Now…</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I don’t think it’s something we ever *hid*.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Right.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>In fact, I was always surprised when… in terms of how large people
> thought they were. In fact, I was surprised at how much news coverage this
> whole event got, because Ma.gnolia is very small, even in terms of its user
> base, it’s very, very small. It’s just com… insignificant compared to any of
> the other real-web applications out there. But it somehow always projected
> this image of being this much bigger thing than it actually was.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah, I mean, even though it’s a small team, or just you, most of the
> time, I don’t think that that necessarily *excuses* what happened, but helps,
> maybe, to put in perspective, y’know, both from this hardware perspective,
> y’know, mostly you keeping it up and running, mostly you doing a lot of the
> work on these things that… I guess there are two things that can come out of
> this. One is that an individual can actually build a fairly, y’know,
> substantial community, relatively speaking, with the tools that exist today…
> that a lot of these tools are more accessible than maybe they once were. For
> example, you mentioned that the commodity-hosting thing sort of, y’know, that
> was the way that you could do it, which isn’t great; or you could do it
> yourself, and bear those possible risks and consequences. But it also says, I
> mean — this is, maybe, y’know, this is an opportunity to go back to where
> Ma.gnolia came from. I mean, I found Ma.gnolia a long time ago largely
> because I read [the web standards book][dwws], by the ‘blue beanie guy’.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Exactly. And he, of course,
> [<span class='organization'>Happy Cog</span>][hcog] did the design of

> [<span class='person'>Jason Santa Maria</span>][jsm] did the logo, and I was

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Well, it’s been a sort of long and shifting road, but to go way way back,
> my background is in cultural anthropology, and I did my graduate work
> developing qualitative research tools. And sort of… I think I sort of revisit
> that every so often, and Ma.gnolia’s one of the revisitations of that work,
> and in a way it’s a tool that helps people gather disparate information, and
> thread it together in ways that make sense to them and their community. So,
> that’s sort of like the way-back origin of Ma.gnolia.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Well what were your goals back then?</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So I think… I mean, it’s funny, I think my goals when I started Ma.gnolia
> were were to — at that point, you could make a lot more money on site
> advertising, so the idea was to build, was much more around a publishing
> model, and… sort of, as we launched the site, and as we watched people
> starting to use it, it was clear that that was not what this was going to be.
> And also was not necessarily true to my background and my work and who I was.
> And so, as… throughout the beta period, and the initial months, and the
> launch, we pretty quickly refocused the site on collaborative, community,
> developing-type tool, rather than just a publishing/advertising-type site.
> And in fact, ads were designed in the original site, and I never turned them
> on until… well, I think actually they were on briefly, but basically I left
> ads off the site until I added the ads-off upgrade. So that’s sort of the
> initial start. And going down that road definitely was the right thing of the
> site. I think it really found its identity, and really had a vision and
> message as a community site.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So would you say that overall, you know, notwithstanding what happened
> recently, the site was a success?</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I think the site was a success in terms of what it brought to people’s
> lives, the community it developed… it definitely was like attracting like, in
> terms of like attracted people who cared about their… environment, I think,
> capital-e Environment, in terms of, like, not just the way the site looked
> and the way the site acted and the interaction, but also, like, the people
> around them, and the other people on the site. It attracted people who were
> thoughtful and caring, I think. So, yeah, I mean, in that sense it was a
> great success, in terms of, I was able to build something I loved for people
> I liked and respected. The site didn’t ever actually make money, was not a
> business or financial success.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So from that perspective, you essentially were bankrolling the project,
> kind of maybe out of a hope at some point it might turn into some sort of
> business or something, but for the most part it sounds like it was a labor of
> love, which a large number of people eventually ended up sort of relying on
> and using on a fairly regular basis.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yes. This was definitely a labor of love. I was doing this because I
> loved to do it. And it was completely self-funded. I would have loved to, and
> I was working towards building a business model around it, with the add-ons,
> and I was working towards, y’know, bringing ads back into the site in a way
> that was more relevant. But some of, a lot of those plans never got executed
> on.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Well, so let’s talk about that. I mean, there are a couple things that
> have changed in the last several years, largely, many more people are using
> social networks now, and there’s a lot more people online. The competitive
> marketplace for sharing bookmarks is probably heated up a bit, even though
> [delicious][del] is probably still the heavyweight, y’know, in the area, just
> because of <span class='organization'>Yahoo!</span>’s involvement…</q>

 [del]: http://delicious.com "Delicious homepage"

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I actually think, I mean, I think Ma.gnolia was a unique thing in terms
> of the community that organized around it. But I think that, in a way, I
> don’t think we could ever compete in the real world of link-sharing. I think
> the biggest link-sharing site right now is Facebook. The people are sharing

> they’re already hanging out in.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Sure.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So <ins>the</ins> destination <ins>of</ins> social bookmarking, I’m not
> sure where that’s going.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So let’s talk about that, then. I mean, obviously, there’s sorta been a
> quiet lull after the storm, if you will, where I think, you know, you need an
> opportunity to maybe collect your thoughts about what happens next. But what
> are you sort of leaning towards right now? I mean, not all the data has been
> retrieved yet, or recovered yet; there are a number of [tools][mgrt] that
> you’ve made available, which you probably could talk a little bit about, but
> in any case, whether the data is able to be retrieved, and people are able to
> get their bookmarks out of Ma.gnolia, is the question of, well, what happens
> in the future? Y’know, three, six, nine months from now, has Ma.gnolia
> recovered, has it come back? Because I think if you make that distinction

> fabric that was created that, though, ripped out of a context because the
> social objects went away, there’s still people who probably would like to
> continue connecting and sharing with one another. So…</q>

 [mgrt]: http://recovery.ma.gnolia.com/ "Ma.gnolia recovery tools page"

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah, and the community has asked for the tool back.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah, they want the tool.</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>So that’ll be coming back, in a modified, in a different sort of way.
> It’ll be coming back in a proper hosting environment, for one thing.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Where you’re not responsible for <abbr class='smallcaps'>IT</abbr> any
> more?</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah. It is gonna go into a more reliable utility…</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Where <span class='person'>Werner Vogels</span> is responsible, the guy
> over at <span class='organization'>Amazon</span>?</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Exactly. And with better backup safeguards in place. I think that’s my
> first priority in bringing it back, is… I mean, you could never guarantee
> anyone a hundred percent of anything, but I can get a lot closer than I was
> in the prior setup. So that’s sort of the biggest change that’s gonna happen,
> in terms of technically how the site is gonna change. In terms of how the
> community is gonna change, it’s gonna, it’s going to… it’s sort of, I think
> as like going back into private beta, that I’m not going to have it open
> registration, that the site is going to relaunch by invitation only, and then
> slowly build up from there. And definitely people who were part of Ma.gnolia
> 1, who were good community members there, will be invited back to join from
> the outset.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Now do you think, I mean, that people can trust you again? Or do you
> think this is just gonna be something that you earn back over time?</q>

> <cite><abbr>LH:</abbr></cite>
> <q>I think it’s gonna be something I earn back over time. I’m gonna
> completely disclose what our infrastructure is, when that’s settled on, and
> let people make the call based on that.</q>

> <cite><abbr>CM:</abbr></cite>
> <q>Yeah, I think, y’know, it’s sort of raised a number of questions, I
> guess, in my mind, about… y’know, again, without that kind of, y’know, Apple
> menu, you see what’s behind these services. I use a lot of web services, and
> I had about 6300 bookmarks on Ma.gnolia, but I have similar sort of
> quantities of stuff — data capital, as I call it — strewn throughout the web
> on other services, for which I have no concept or idea of how they perform
> backups. So it’s been interesting for me to, y’know, witness some folks in
> the [Get Satisfaction][gets] forums were coming and, y’know, making these
> claims about oh, this is preventable, and you could’ve done this or done
> that, and sort of, y’know, playing armchair
> <abbr class='smallcaps'>IT</abbr> professional and saying, well you could’ve
> done all these different things, but at the same time we don’t have a great
> deal of disclosure from other web services too. So it’s not just that
> Ma.gnolia was the only one doing this, it’s that there was an experience here
> that sort of sheds some light on these different
> <abbr class='smallcaps'>IT</abbr> practices, I guess, for better or worse. I
> imagine that there are a lot of other, for example, applications out there,
> y’know, that are built to serve the Twitter community, that are probably
> equally, if not much worse off, than Ma.gnolia from an infrastructure
> perspective. So it raises a broader question, I think, about, y’know, who we
> are entrusting with our data, and where we’re putting it, where we’re hosting
> it… And in some ways, making sure that there is a personal sort of connection
> or relationship there, I think it becomes more important over time. I mean,
> if you imagine these services as kind of like your bank, and you wanna
> entrust your bank, y’know, over time I think that individuals, now that
> you’ve had this experience, you’re never gonna repeat this problem, y’know,
> this situation. Other services may have to similarly have that kind of
> experience until we realize this is actually a big deal, and this is a
> long-term sort of, y’know, consideration to make. I mean, a lot of the work
> that, let’s say, I do with OpenID is around also helping OpenID providers
> understand and realize the gravity of their purpose. Y’know, it’s just like
> if your email went away, what would you do? For a lot of people, I think that
> would be very very bad. So there’s that, is that question, like, sure, people
> could keep countless backups of their own data on their own machines, and
> things like that; and only recently, though with tools like
> [Time Machine][tmac] has even personal backups become somewhat more
> accessible. So this is, I think, a question for many more people than just
