> It is well known that I was on two occasions brutally assaulted, while on
> another my house was sprayed with machine-gun fire. Despite the governmentâ€™s
> sanctimonious assurances, there was never a serious police inquiry into the
> perpetrators of these attacks, and the attackers were never apprehended. In
> all these cases, I have reason to believe the attacks were inspired by the
> government. When finally I am killed, it will be the government that kills
> me.
