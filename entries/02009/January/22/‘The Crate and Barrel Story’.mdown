I’m intrigued by the idea of curated retail — presenting the customer with a
careful selection of goods, rather than simply displaying products from anybody
who fills categories or will cut a good distribution deal.

> Every display is carefully executed and every piece of merchandise is
> carefully edited, according to
> <span class='person'><ins>Gordon</ins> Segal</span>. He believes that a
> specialty retailer has a point of view <abbr>vs.</abbr> a department store,
> which tries to be all things to all people. <q>We’re editors, we’re selectors.
> We make it easier for the consumer to find a particular variety of product.
> If you like French traditional, you don’t come to
> <span class='organization'>Crate and Barrel</span>. If you want contemporary,
> you might come to us or any of our competitors, but you know what we stand
> for.</q>
