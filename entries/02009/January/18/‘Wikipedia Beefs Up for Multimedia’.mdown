> For example, users are uploading public domain classical music, and some
> recordings can last a half-hour. Documentary films that are out of copyright
> are also being uploaded, and some users are struggling to keep files under
> the 100<abbr class='smallcaps'>MB</abbr> limit, according to Vibber.

> Vibberâ€™s long-term goal is to let users upload feature-length, high-quality
> videos, but in addition to capacity limits he says there are challenges
> related to getting files in the appropriate format and the physical movement
> of large files.
